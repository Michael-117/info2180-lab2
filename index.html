                        The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime.
                        They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved.
                        The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move.
                        The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. The answer to that question was obvious.
                        Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again.

                        It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system.
                        The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. 
                        That doesn't mean they are easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you're willing to open your mind a bit you don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.

                        It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. 
                        While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. 
                        The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.

                        She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. 
                        He had the power to put her in the room, but not the power to make her repent. 
                        It wasn't fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she wouldn't change her attitude. 
                        At three years old, Sandy's stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view. 
                        It had become a far too common an event in her life. 
                        She has specifically placed the key to the box in a special place so that she wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. 
                        Now that she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.

                        The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance. 
                        Dave knew this feeling all too well. The calm before the storm. 
                        He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness. 
                        Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't.
                        Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by.

                        He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. 
                        He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. 
                        He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.
